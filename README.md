ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stagman88.

Currently in the process of learning front end development. I've learnt a vast amount over the past 2 years of study and feel like I have only scratched the surface of code development.
I'm currently learning more about Angular as a development platform. As and when I complete my own personal projects I will push the code on my github repository.
Open on working on projects, so feel free to send me a message :)
